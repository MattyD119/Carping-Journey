        It has now been 5 years since I have been fishing and I one day found myself on the bank at 
        Hawkhurst Fish Farm. I stare out into the lake with a renewed sense of excitment but also a 
        bit of trepedation because I felt that I had forgotten how to catch carp. I wasn't 
        particularly succesful that session either so when I next visited the tackle shop only to 
        discover that Korda were giving away a free DVD with 4 hours of content I was excited to say
        the least. These were the days before YouTube and watching content like this for the first 
        time was amazing and within a few days I had watched the whole thing and rewatched the 
        sections on areas that helped in the areas that I felt a little rusty in like rig making.

        Now I felt up to date it was time to get back to the lake and instantly I felt like a renewed
        angler and this showed in my results. I started to have success and my hooked to landed ratio 
        was excellent.
